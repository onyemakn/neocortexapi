# **Project Description**
  
The HTM implementation in neocortexapi already provides some sort of 
persistence, which is not finished. The persistence is designed as 
implementation of a custom serializer/deserilizer. The serializer saves the 
instance of some HTM module to the stream and deserializer is responsible 
to crete the instance from the stream. My task is to analyse the current 
implementation and complete it.
  
## 1. **Objective: Analyse The Current Implementation
